Data Loader (data_loader.py)
Loads raw historical data (CSV in this example) and performs data cleaning & optional resampling into multiple time frames.

Indicator Calculator (indicator_calculator.py)
Adds technical indicators (EMA, RSI, etc.) as columns on the DataFrame.

Entry Manager & Exit Manager (entry_manager.py & exit_manager.py)
Provided code snippets that define the entry and exit conditions, respectively.

Strategy Logic (strategy_logic.py)
Coordinates between EntryManager and ExitManager. Maintains the current position state, checks for signals on every bar.

Execution Simulator (execution_simulator.py)
Mocks the process of opening and closing trades based on signals. Records all completed trades.

Performance Analyzer (performance_analyzer.py)
Calculates PnL, win rate, drawdown, etc. from the trade log.

Results & Reporting (results_and_reporting.py)
Exports trades to CSV and plots a basic equity curve. Expand this to generate more detailed PDF/HTML reports if desired.

Backtesting App (backtesting_app.py)
Brings all modules together into a cohesive pipeline:

Load data → 2. Resample → 3. Calculate indicators →
Generate signals → 5. Simulate trades → 6. Analyze performance → 7. Produce reports.
